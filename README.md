## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   A [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chaat.git
cd chaat
```

Next, install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key

This is the most important step to make the AI work.

1.  Run the app for the first time: `npm run dev`
2.  Open the app in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
3.  Navigate to the **"Me"** tab at the bottom.
4.  Click on **"+ Add API Key"**.
5.  Give your key a name (e.g., "My Key") and paste the key value.
6.  Save it. The key will be securely stored in your browser's database.

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the local development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now start building and customizing your app!

##  Git & Version Control

If you're using this template to start your own project, hereâ€™s how to manage it with Git.

### Initializing Your Own Repository

After cloning or creating the project, you can initialize your own Git history.

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new git repository
git init -b main

# 2. Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# 3. Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup project from template"
```

### Making and Committing Changes

As you work on the project, follow this simple workflow to save your changes.

```bash
# 1. Stage all your new changes for the next commit
git add .

# 2. Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add new character details page"

# Example commit message types:
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Changes to documentation
# style: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc; no code change
# refactor: Refactoring production code
# test: Adding tests, refactoring test code
```

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment to GitHub Pages

You can host this app for free on GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Build the App

Create a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy

This command will automatically push the contents of the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch in your repository.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Troubleshooting Deployment

If the `npm run deploy` command fails due to network issues, you may need to set a temporary proxy for your terminal session.

**For macOS / Linux:**
Open your terminal and run these commands before `npm run deploy`. Replace `7897` if your proxy port is different.
```bash
export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897
export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897
```

**For Windows (PowerShell):**


```powershell
set GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=http://127.0.0.1:7897
```

After setting the proxy, run the deployment command again. This proxy setting is temporary and only applies to the current terminal window.

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

1.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
2.  Under "Build and deployment", set the **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
3.  Set the **Branch** to `gh-pages` with the `/(root)` folder.
4.  Save your changes. Your app will be live in a few minutes!
